## **APP ENGINE VS CLOUD RUN**

___

App Engine and Cloud Run are both serverless computing platforms offered by Google Cloud Platform. While they share some similarities, they have some key differences in terms of capabilities, maintenance, and cost. Here's a comparison of the two platforms:


**Capabilities:**

*   App Engine is a fully managed platform that allows you to develop and deploy web applications, APIs, and mobile backends using a variety of languages and frameworks. It supports automatic scaling, load balancing, and can handle tasks such as data storage, authentication, and push notifications. App Engine also offers a number of built-in services such as Cloud Datastore, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL.


*   Cloud Run is a fully managed platform for containerized applications that allows you to run stateless HTTP containers on demand. It supports a variety of languages and frameworks and can be used for microservices, serverless functions, and event-driven applications. Cloud Run also allows you to bring your own Docker container and offers integrations with other Google Cloud services such as Cloud Pub/Sub and Cloud Storage.


**Maintenance:**

*   App Engine is a fully managed platform that handles most of the infrastructure management, automatic scaling, and load balancing for you. This means you can focus on writing code and not worry about the underlying infrastructure. However, you still need to manage your application code, updates, and any external dependencies.

*   Cloud Run is also a fully managed platform that handles most of the infrastructure management, scaling, and load balancing. However, because you're responsible for creating and maintaining the container image, you have more control over the dependencies, runtime versions, and libraries that your application uses.

**Cost:**

*   App Engine offers a free tier that includes 28 instance hours, 5GB of storage, and 1GB of egress traffic per month. After that, pricing is based on the number of instance hours, storage, and egress traffic used, as well as any additional services you use.

*   Cloud Run also offers a free tier that includes 180,000 vCPU-seconds and 360,000 GiB-seconds of memory usage per month. After that, pricing is based on the number of vCPU-seconds, memory usage, and any additional services you use.


Overall, App Engine is a good choice if you're developing a web application or API and want a fully managed platform that can handle most of the infrastructure management for you. Cloud Run is a good choice if you're running containerized applications and want more control over the dependencies and runtime environment. In terms of cost, both platforms offer a free tier that can be a good starting point for small projects.
